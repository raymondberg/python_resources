# Python Resources

I get asked for Python resources quite often. It's time to stop keeping this in my brain.

### Level System

Levels are used to describe what general region of experience the tool targets.
Read this first, as some of these skew more toward describing the early-learner
end of the scale of Python knowledge.

* Beginner - Someone who is just learning the syntax, structure and flow of
Python or, perhaps, all programming languages. At the beginning of this phase
you have no ability to write code, and at the end you can read basic code and
write a few lines yourself.
* Intermediate - Someone who is able to kick out a function, class, script, or
program with some coaching or a good set of resources by their side.
* Advanced - Someone who is learning the intracies of a specific area of
development (webdev, or datascience) or is looking at optimization and design
at a level higher than individual segments of code.
* Master - Someone proficient and could be employed as a developer in various
capacities and is looking for more learning opportunities. Note: Master and
Mastery here is used in the present and perpetual sense; we all learn until we
die.

Don't filter just because a resource isn't exactly at your perceived level.
